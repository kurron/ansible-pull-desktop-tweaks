#Overview
This project is a sub-project of the [JVM Development Environment](https://github.com/kurron/jvm-development-environment). 
The Ansible plays described here will be applied to the Vagrant environment being built.  The purpose of this project 
is to install a variety of custom tools and conveniences into the Vagrant box.

#Prerequisites
Nothing additional to what is required by the JVM Development Environment project. 

#Building
All the components of the environment live in repositories on the internet so there is nothing to build.

#Installation
This project is intended to be invoked by the JVM Development Environment project so there is no installation step.

#Tips and Tricks

##Applied Conveniences

* set up Git credentials
* tweak `.bashrc`
* change the login icon
* update `/etc/hosts` with entries to local machines
* check out frequently edited Git projects
* install tools I like, like [WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/) and [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/)
